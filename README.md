# SIT323-2025-Prac5.2D: Dockerized & Cloud-Published Microservice

## Overview
This repository contains the updated version of my Express microservice. I improved the code by modifying the HTTP response to serve an HTML page with basic styling, making the output more user-friendly. The application is containerized using Docker, and the Docker image is published to Google Cloudâ€™s Container Registry. This update demonstrates the deployment of the microservice to the cloud as part of Task 5.2D.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A Google Cloud account with a project set up and the Container Registry API enabled
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured

## Files Included
- **index.js**: Express server code that now serves an HTML page.
- **Dockerfile**: Instructions to build the Docker image.
- **docker-compose.yml**: (Optional) Docker Compose configuration.
- **package.json & package-lock.json**: Node.js dependency files.
- **README.md**: This file.

## How I Completed the Task
1. **Code Update**:  
   - Modified `index.js` to serve an HTML page with CSS styling instead of plain text.
   - The HTML includes a container that centers the text and makes it look cleaner.

2. **Dockerization**:  
   - Created a Dockerfile to containerize the updated microservice.
   - Built the Docker image locally with:
     ```bash
     docker build -t dockerporthr/task5 .
     ```

3. **Publishing to Google Cloud**:  
   - Tagged the Docker image using:
     ```bash
     docker tag dockerporthr/task5 gcr.io/cloud-native-microservice/task5
     ```
   - Pushed the image to Google Cloud Container Registry with:
     ```bash
     docker push gcr.io/cloud-native-microservice/task5
     ```

4. **Testing the Microservice**:
   - Ran the image locally with:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 3000:3000 gcr.io/cloud-native-microservice/task5
     ```
   - Verified that the HTML page appears correctly at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

## Running Locally
To run the microservice locally:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 gcr.io/cloud-native-microservice/task5
